# README.md git

This directory contains slides, speaker notes, and a command-line transcript for the `git` lesson.

## Viewing the lesson slides

The lesson slides in `slides_git.md` are readable as Markdown files in any text editor. They are written to use the [`reveal-md`](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) tool, and if this is installed, they can be viewed with the command:

```
reveal-md --theme=white slides_git.md
```

The speaker notes in `speaker_notes.md` are also written in Markdown and can be read using any text editor.
